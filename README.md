# ECS 261 Homework 2: Verification in Dafny

### Due date: Friday, February 13, 11:59pm

## Getting started

For this homework, you will need to have a machine with VSCode
and the Dafny VSCode extension installed.
You should have installed these as part of HW0.

This is a programming assignment, where you will directly edit the source files.
There are a few parts:
- Part 1 is a series of mini exercises.
- Part 2 is about classes and class invariants.
- Part 3 is about writing verified code with loop invariants.

As with HW1, the assignment will be submitted through Gradescope.

To continue, open and edit the files `part1.dfy`, `part2.dfy`, and `part3.dfy`.

## Getting help

If you get stuck, selected hints for some problems are in the file `hints.md`.

I have always found the [Dafny tutorial](https://dafny.org/dafny/OnlineTutorial/guide.html)
and [Dafny cheatsheet](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyCheatsheet.pdf)
to be super helpful.

Beyond these: please continue to ask questions on Piazza and drop by office hours!
